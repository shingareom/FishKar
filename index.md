# Siddhi Baat, No Bakwas

This setup script **takes a fresh Linux machine** and turns it into a **no-nonsense productivity beast** with **zero manual effort**.

## What This Setup Does?

- **Updates your system** (Because you ain’t running outdated junk)
- **Installs Fish shell** (Default shells are for NPCs)
- **Installs must-have tools** like Neovim, fzf, tmux, Fisher, and clipboard utilities
- **Downloads & applies your Fish config** (No need to set up manually)
- **Sets Fish as your default shell** (Because it’s faster, better, and smarter)
- **Downloads & applies Neovim config** (Your Vim setup, ready in seconds)
- **Fixes PATH issues** (No more ‘command not found’ nonsense)

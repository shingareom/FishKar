# **Siddhi Baat, No Bakwas**  

This setup script **takes a fresh Linux machine** and turns it into a **no-nonsense productivity beast** with **zero manual effort**.  

### **What This Setup Does?**  
- **Updates your system** (Because you ain't running outdated junk)  
- **Installs Fish shell** (Default shells are for NPCs)  
- **Installs must-have tools** like Neovim, fzf, tmux, Fisher, and clipboard utilities  
- **Downloads & applies your Fish config** (No need to set up manually)  
- **Sets Fish as your default shell** (Because it's faster, better, and smarter)  
- **Downloads & applies Neovim config** (Your Vim setup, ready in seconds)  
- **Fixes PATH issues** (No more ‘command not found’ nonsense)  

### **How to Run?**  
Save the script as `setup.sh`, then:  
```bash
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```
Boom. **Your system is now optimized, clean, and fast.** No excuses left.
